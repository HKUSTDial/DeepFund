# DeepFund

[![arXiv](https://img.shields.io/badge/arXiv-2503.18313-<COLOR>.svg)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18313)

This project serves as an ideal solution to the below key question:

**Will LLM Be Professional At Fund Investment? A Live Arena perspective**

We evaluate the trading capability of LLM across various financial markets given a unified environment. The LLM shall ingest external information, drive a multi-agent system, and make trading decisions. The LLM performance will be presented in a trading arena view across various dimensions.

## Setup Environment
Pre-requisite: Install Conda (if not already installed): Go to [anaconda.com/download](https://www.anaconda.com/download/).

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/tigerlcl/deepfund.git
cd deepfund
```

2. Create a virtual env from the env configuration file:
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

3. Set up environment variables:
```bash
# Create .env file for your API keys
cp .env.example .env
```

## Setup Database
We apply **SQLite** as the database to store the agent activities and portfolio status when running the system.

```bash
cd src
python database/setup.py
# This will create a sqlite database in the path `src/assets/deepfund.db`
```
> You may install VSCode Extension [SQLite Viewer](https://marketplace.cursorapi.com/items?itemName=qwtel.sqlite-viewer) to view the database.

## Running the System
Enter the `src` directory and run the `main.py` file with configuration:
```bash
cd src
python main.py --config xxx.yaml
```
> configs are saved in `src/config`

Config file sample:
```yaml
# Trading settings
tickers:
  - MSFT
  - NVDA

# Analysts to run, refer to graph.constants.py
# Omit workflow_analysts to run planner mode
workflow_analysts:
  - fundamental
  - technical
  - news

# LLM model settings, refer to llm/inference.py: LLMConfig
llm:
  provider: "DeepSeek" 
  model: "deepseek-chat" # DeepSeek-V3
```

Running output (NVDA on Date 2025-03-28, Fundamental + News Analyst, DeepSeek-V3)
```log
INFO - NVDA workflow compiled successfully
INFO - Agent: fundamental | Ticker: NVDA | Status: Fetching financial metrics
INFO - Agent: news | Ticker: NVDA | Status: Fetching company news
INFO - Agent: fundamental | Ticker: NVDA | Signal: Bullish | Justification: The analysis indicates strong bullish signals across all key metrics: Profitability, Growth, and Financial Health. This comprehensive strength suggests a robust financial position and potential for future outperformance.
INFO - Agent: news | Ticker: NVDA | Signal: Bullish | Justification: The majority of the recent news articles about Nvidia (NVDA) are overwhelmingly positive, highlighting strong fundamentals, growth potential, and bullish endorsements from analysts and institutions. Titles such as 'Nvidia Stock Is Down Over 20% From Its All-Time High. Here's Why It Could Soar by the End of 2025' and 'Bank of America: NVDA Will Ultimately Head Higher, Driven by Very Strong Fundamentals' suggest optimism about the stock's future performance. Additionally, mentions of Nvidia's role in AI and partnerships (e.g., Cisco deal) further bolster the bullish sentiment. While there is one neutral piece about a shortage of Nvidia chips in China, it does not outweigh the positive sentiment from the other articles.
INFO - Agent: portfolio manager | Ticker: NVDA | Status: Making trading decisions
INFO - Decision for NVDA: Buy | Shares: 2 | Price: 110.3 | Reason: Despite the overwhelmingly bullish signals from the analysts, the remaining shares allowed for purchases are limited to 2.0. Given the strong fundamentals, growth potential, and positive sentiment, it is prudent to fully utilize the remaining allocation to capitalize on the bullish trend.
INFO - NVDA position update: cashflow=74819.08 positions={'NVDA': Position(value=220.6, shares=226), ...}
